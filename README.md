"The idea was that each and every person of the community could sign up on the websote and register records of people who have either paid back what they owe him/her on time, late, or haven't paid back at all, so that other people can look them up in the website and judge them by their records./nWe used Python/Django for Server, MySQL as database, and HTML5, CSS, and JS for the front./nUnfortunately, the website was online only for two months. It ran into some legal problems and we had to shut it down. What you see here is the latest version which was running on the server./nIf you want to run it on a local server in your own system, you're gonna have to change the database settings either to a simple sqlite DB, or have a MySQL server running and put the username and password in the settings."
